# Block some pesky ads

Combined from several filter lists to avoid some pesky ads on sites in Russia in addition with other filter lists.
For example, can be used with optimized Adguard filters without need to use giant Easylist or Adguard English filter.

Block some ads from:
- Youtube (includes video ads blocking)
- Yandex (not 100%, but blocks a lot of annoying things). Beware! Totally blocks Yandex Zen!
- Mail.ru (not 100%, but blocks a lot of annoying things). Beware! Totally blocks viqeo.tv and newstube video!
- Rambler
- some cosmetic rules for ad banners and cookie popups blocking.

# N.B. This is beta branch. Something might go wrong.
